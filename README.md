# Ex-2-Comparative-Analysis-of-Different-Types-of-Prompting-Patterns
## 1. Objective:
The goal of this experiment is to evaluate how various prompting patterns (broad/unstructured vs. basic/refined) influence the responses generated by language models. We aim to analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of outputs based on the structure and clarity of the prompt provided.

## 2. Prompting Patterns Defined:

### Broad/Unstructured Prompts: 
These are vague or open-ended queries without specific direction.

### Basic/Refined Prompts: 
These are clear, focused, and well-structured queries with a defined scope.

## 3. Test Scenarios:

### Scenario 1: 
General Knowledge Inquiry

### Broad Prompt: 
"Tell me about AI."

### Refined Prompt: 
"Explain how artificial intelligence is used in the healthcare industry."

### Analysis:

### Broad: 
Response may include a wide range of topics, from history to applications across industries.

### Refined:
Focused and relevant, specifically addressing healthcare use cases.

### Scenario 2: 
Creative Writing

### Broad Prompt: 
"Write a story."

### Refined Prompt:
"Write a short science fiction story about time travel involving a scientist who changes history."

### Analysis:

### Broad: 
Results in generic stories with unpredictable themes.

### Refined: 
Encourages cohesive narrative, structured plot, and creativity within bounds.

### Scenario 3: 
Code Generation

### Broad Prompt: 
"Write Python code."

### Refined Prompt: 
"Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion."

### Analysis:

### Broad: 
May generate irrelevant or oversimplified code.

### Refined:
Provides a specific, usable, and relevant code snippet.

### Scenario 4: 
Opinion-Based Query

### Broad Prompt: 
"What do you think about education?"

### Refined Prompt: 
"Discuss the impact of online education on student learning outcomes in higher education."

### Analysis:

### Broad: 
General opinions without depth.

### Refined: 
Detailed analysis with targeted arguments and evidence.

### Scenario 5: 
Troubleshooting Assistance

### Broad Prompt: 
"Help me with my code."

### Refined Prompt: 
"I'm getting a 'TypeError' when I try to sum a list of integers in Python. What's the issue and how can I fix it?"

### Analysis:

### Broad: 
Needs more context; response may be too generic.

### Refined: 
Directly addresses the problem with diagnostic advice.

## 4. Conclusion:
Refined prompts consistently lead to more accurate, relevant, and in-depth responses. Broad prompts may work for exploratory purposes but often lack precision. For high-quality outputs, refining the prompt with clear intent and context is essential.

## 5. Recommendations:

Use refined prompts when expecting actionable or technical results.

Employ broad prompts during brainstorming or creative exploration.

Always define the scope to avoid irrelevant or shallow responses.

## 6. Future Work:
Extend this analysis to evaluate performance across different LLMs and domains (e.g., law, medicine, education) and quantify response quality through user feedback and scoring metrics.
